/* 
Static Methods and Abstract Methods:
1. Static methods belong to the class itself, not to any specific instance.
2. Abstract methods, on the other hand, require implementation in subclasses.

Combining these concepts would lead to a contradiction:
1. Abstract methods imply no implementation (they are placeholders).
2. Static methods always have an implementation (they can be called directly without creating an instance).

Why Static Methods Cannot Be Abstract:
If static methods were allowed to be abstract, it would create confusion:
1. Abstract methods are meant to be overridden by subclasses.
2. Static methods are called directly on the class (no instance required).
There would be no way to provide an overridden implementation for an abstract static method because static methods donâ€™t participate in inheritance chains. */
