 In Java, I/O streams are essential for reading and writing data from various sources and destinations. Letâ€™s explore the basics:

What Are I/O Streams?
I/O streams represent input sources or output destinations.
They can handle different types of data, including bytes, characters, and objects.
Streams can connect to files, devices, network sockets, or even memory arrays.
Types of Streams:
Byte Streams: Handle raw binary data (e.g., reading/writing files).
Character Streams: Process character-based data (e.g., text files).
Object Streams: Work with serialized objects (e.g., saving/loading Java objects).
Common Operations:
Reading: Programs use an input stream to read data from a source.
Writing: Programs use an output stream to write data to a destination.
